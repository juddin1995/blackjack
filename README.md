# Blackjack
The objective of Blackjack, also known as Twenty-One, is to beat the dealer by getting a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer's hand, without going over 21.

# How to Win
* Blackjack: If your first two cards are an Ace and a 10-value card (10, Jack, Queen, King), this is an automatic win (Blackjack).

* Higher Value than Dealer: If your hand total is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand total without going bust, you win. Winnings are typically paid out at 1:1.

* Dealer Busts: If the dealer's hand total goes over 21 (busts), you win regardless of your hand value.

* Push: If your hand total equals the dealer's hand total, it's a tie (push) and your bet is returned without any winnings or losses.

* Lower Value than Dealer: If the dealer's hand total is closer to 21 than yours without busting, you lose your bet.
